# Chat Application - ReadMe

### Project Overview

This is a full-stack chat application built using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user and chat data.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface and client-side functionality.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **Socket.IO**: A real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication library used for the real-time chat functionality.

The application allows users to create accounts, log in, and engage in real-time chat conversations with other users.

### Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time using Socket.IO.
- **Conversation History**: All messages are stored in the MongoDB database, allowing users to view previous chat history.
- **Online Status**: Users can see which of their contacts are currently online and available to chat.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Getting Started

To run the chat application locally, follow these steps:


1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the root directory and run `npm install`.
   - Navigate to the chat directory and run `npm install`.


3. **Set up the environment**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the following environment variables:
     - `MONGO_URI`: The connection string for your MongoDB database.
     - `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used for JWT token generation.
   - Create a `.env` file in the client directory and add the following environment variable:
     - `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL`: This is not needed you can update this if you want to be secure 

4. **Start the development servers**:
   - In the root directory, run `npm start` to start the backend server.
   - automatically this will start thr frontend as this is a single web service

5. **Access the application**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the chat application.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

1. **backend**:
   - Contains the server-side code, including the MongoDB connection, API routes, and Socket.IO implementation.
   - The main entry point is `server.ts`.

2. **chat-app**:
   - Contains the client-side code, including the React components, Redux state management, and Socket.IO integration.
   - The main entry point is `index.tsx`.
